  bio: "I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on the study of a wide range of explosive transients including supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, cataclysmic variables, fast blue optical transients, and gravitational waves. I use multi-wavelength follow-up observations to understand the energetics and environments of these cosmic explosions.",
