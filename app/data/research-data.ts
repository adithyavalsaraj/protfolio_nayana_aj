    title: "Fast Blue Optical Transients",
    description:
      "Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) are a rare class of cosmic explosions that evolve much more rapidly and reach higher peak luminosities than ordinary supernovae. They brighten and fade within days, exhibiting unusually hot (blue) optical colors. A rather small fraction of FBOTs at the most luminous end of the phase space (LFBOTs) show bright X-ray and radio emission. The observed properties of FBOTs challenge traditional supernova models, and their physical origin remains an open question. Alternate possible scenarios include massive-star explosions with dense circumstellar environments, tidal disruption–like events, or explosions powered by compact central engines such as magnetars or black holes. My work has been focused on building a multi-wavelength picture of FBOTs—spanning radio, millimeter, optical, and X-ray bands—to uncover the nature of their progenitors and surrounding environments. I have led and coordinated rapid follow-up campaigns using facilities such as GMRT, ATCA, MeerKAT, ALMA, and JVLA, and contributed to detailed studies of LFBOTs. Through these efforts, I aim to bridge the gap between FBOTs, relativistic explosions, and the broader population of stellar transients.",

    title: "Core-collapse Supernovae",
    description:
      "X-ray and radio observations provide powerful probes of the immediate environments of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), tracing the interaction between the expanding shock and the circumstellar material shed by the progenitor star in its final stages of evolution. These diagnostics offer direct insight into the progenitor’s mass-loss history, wind properties, and explosion energetics, which are key ingredients for understanding how massive stars end their lives. My research combines sensitive, multi-epoch radio and X-ray monitoring of young supernovae to map their shock evolution and circumstellar density profiles. Through coordinated campaigns using multiple facilities (X-ray and radio), I aim to connect observed diversity in CCSNe to the physical properties of their progenitors and environments. A recent highlight of this effort is my work on SN 2023ixf, one of the closest and best-studied Type II supernovae, where combined radio and X-ray data reveal a complex CSM environment shedding light on the final phases of massive-star evolution.",

    title: "Galactic novae",
    description:
      "Novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variables characterized by thermonuclear eruptions on the surface of a white dwarf that accretes matter from its binary companion. These eruptions provide a unique window into accretion physics, binary evolution, and shock interactions on human-observable timescales. My work focuses on understanding the shock evolution and particle acceleration in recurrent and classical novae through radio observations, particularly at low frequencies. A key highlight of this effort is my work on the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi, where we captured the rapid evolution of non-thermal radio emission, constraining the density of the circumbinary medium",
